# linux_admin_scripts
Scripts to assist with administering a linux os.
These help with the everyday task of gathering common information about your computer. For example the system_checker.sh script
gives details about system usage, ports open, who has been logged on the computer, etc... and gives all this information opens 
in a web browser (firefox) for easy viewing or sending emails.

Directions:
* Important * if you do not have firefox installed, this script won't work. It is dependent on a web browser to run.
1) Run the setup script
2) type 'system_checker.sh' into the cli.
